## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project helped to reinforce the basic of css grid. I learned to how to structure the html to better fit the 
grid layout. I also learned about the html data attribute. In this challenge I used it to differentiate the number 
keys from the operator keys by assigning the opertaor keys a "data-action" attribute. This porject helped to strengthen my foundation of vanilla javascript.
